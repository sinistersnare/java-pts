# Java Points-To Analysis for Soufflé

This repository contains a modified DOOP extractor and a modified points-to specifications for Soufflé.
Currently there are two points-to analyses implemented in form of logical specifications: context-insensitive with call-graph construction on the fly and context-sensitive (2-Heap + 1-Object). 

The extractor can be build by typing 

```
./gradlew build
```

The extractor can be invoked by typing 

```
java -jar build/lib/extractor.jar <program-to-analyse.jar> -lsystem -d <fact-dir>
```

where `<program-to-analyze.jar>` is the jar file for which the fact files are produced and `<fact-dir>` is the directory where the fact files are written to. 

To use an example from the `examples/` directory:

```
java -jar build/lib/extractor.jar examples/HelloWorld.jar -lsystem -d hello-facts
```

The modified DOOP points-to analysis has been provided by Oracle Labs:
